/*
JavaScript defines the following datatypes:

primitive:
	number
	string
	boolean

Trivial:
	null
	undefined

composite datatype:
	object (collection of values)

   - Object (unordered collection of named values)
   - Array  (ordered collection of numbered values)

special object function

   - A function is an object that has exucutable code associated with it.

*/

/*
The ECMAScript standard defines six data types:

	Number
	String
	Boolean
	Null
	Undefined
	Object

All types except objects define immutable values. Specifically,
 strings are immutable (unlike in C for instance). We refer to values of these types as "primitive values."
